Welcome to my personal homepage! As a researcher, lecturer and policy advisor/cosultant with nearly two decades of experience in Science, Technology, and Innovation Studies (STI), my biggest passion is exploring the heterogeneity of innovation. I have expertise in both quantitative and qualitative research methods, allowing me to address complex socio-economic phenomena using traditional and novel data sources.

My research interests are focused on the following areas:

- Measurement of Innovation: How to measure innovation, dissemination of technologies or technological inequalities? My experience in innovation surveys, composite indexes, and scoreboards allows me to identify micro, macro, and meso-level indicators to capture firm strategies, development, change, technological upgrading, dissemination of advanced production technologies and organizational practices, impact of R&D, and research evaluation.
- Business Innovation Studies: My expertise lies in innovation strategies, organizational culture for innovation, open innovation, ecological innovation, and transformative innovation.
- Innovation, Technology and Society: user innovation and grassroots innovation, people's attitudes towards new technologies and acceptance of new technologies.
- Governance of Innovation Systems: I specialize in technological upgrading and catch-up, transformative dynamics, path dependence and bounded change, efficiency of institutions and linkages, industry-science cooperation, patterns of innovation behavior, taxonomies of innovation, and evidence for systemic and diagnosis-based innovation policy.
- (Micro-)econometrics of Innovation and Technology and Causal Inference: I have skills in machine learning-enabled studies of innovation and digital trace of innovation. 

I teach:

- Courses about better using data for informed decision-making: Data and Decisions; Introductory Statistics; Econometrics of Causal Inference
- Courses covering hot topics in innovation studies: Innovation management, Economics of innovation and technological change.

I am committed to exploring the complex context of STI and understanding the unique features that drive innovation. As such, I am excited to share my knowledge and collaborate with teams and organizations that seek to explore innovation capacities and develop evidence-based policies. Please feel free to write me  for further exploring our mutual interests.
