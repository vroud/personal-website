      <description>&lt;p&gt;I teach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Courses about better using data for informed decision-making: Data and Decisions; Introductory Statistics; Econometrics of Causal Inference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courses covering hot topics in innovation studies: Innovation management, Economics of innovation and technological change.
â€” Introductory courses to engage newcommers into the beautiy of the contemporary social sciences and economic analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had the opportunity to teach at both Master&amp;rsquo;s and Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s levels, and conduct professional training workshops, I can offer a variety of educational services. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate to guide and mentor students through their theses and PhD dissertations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas I enjoy working on is helping others develop their research skills. This covers understanding and using different research methods, learning to organize their work effectively, and mastering the activities necessary to successfully complete research projects. My aim is to assist individuals in improving their research capabilities in a supportive and easy-to-understand manner.&lt;/p&gt;
