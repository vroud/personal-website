      <description>&lt;p&gt;I teach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courses covering hot topics in innovation studies: Innovation management, Economics of innovation and technological change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courses about better using data for informed decision-making: Data and Decisions; Introductory Statistics; Econometrics of Causal Inference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introductory courses to engage newcomers into the beautiy of the contemporary social sciences and economic analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had the opportunity to &lt;em&gt;teach at PhD,  Master&amp;rsquo;s and Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s levels, and conduct professional training workshops&lt;/em&gt;, I can offer a variety of educational services. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate to supervise students through their theses and PhD dissertations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas I enjoy working on is helping others develop their research skills. This covers &lt;em&gt;mentoring  personal research projects&lt;/em&gt;, understanding and using different research methods, learning to organize their work effectively, and mastering the activities necessary to successfully complete research with solid deliverables. My aim is to assist individuals in improving their research capabilities in a supportive and easy-to-understand manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have contributed to the design, marketing, and administration of educational programs and had the opportunity to be part of the team that successfully pursued EFMD accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I possess a keen interest in &lt;em&gt;Learning Experience Design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
